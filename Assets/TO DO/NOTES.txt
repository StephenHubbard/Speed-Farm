Some kind of rent payment that ticks down gold based on how much land you own
Could have an npc tax collect roaming around the town and whenever he gets to farm you pay tax
(water bill, real estate, tax man)

have different types of cards to buy
veggie card / fruit card / animal card (eggs, milk, sheep hair, etc)

lose condition?  One orbit before collector comes back.  Flash a loss warning or something along those lines when they're getting close.
